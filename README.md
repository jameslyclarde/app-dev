# My Favorite Movie: "Black Clover: Sword of the Wizard King"
Black Clover: Sword of the Wizard King (Japanese: ブラッククローバー 魔法帝の剣, Hepburn: Burakku Kurōbā: Mahōtei no Ken) is a Japanese animated fantasy action film directed by Ayataka Tanemura and produced by Pierrot. Based on the shōnen manga series Black Clover by Yūki Tabata, the film was released in Japanese theaters by Shochiku on June 16, 2023. It received an international streaming release on Netflix the same day.

## Plot
Asta, a boy born with no magic in a world where magic is everything, and his rival Yuno, a genius mage chosen by the legendary 4-leaf Grimoire, have together fought a number of powerful enemies to prove their power beyond adversity and aim for the top mage "Wizard King".

Conrad Leto, the former predecessor of Julius Novachrono, once commanded the respect of the people in the Clover Kingdom. However, he unexpectedly turned against the kingdom and was subsequently sealed away by Julius himself. Now, Conrad has resurfaced and he wields the "Imperial Sword" and seeks to destroy the Clover Kingdom and bring forth a new era where equality prevails by destroying all and reviving only those whom he considers deserving of a place in his envisioned society.

He uses the power of the sword to revive three wizard kings of the past: Edward Avalaché, Princia Funnybunny, and Jester Garandaros, who share the same vision as him, in order to achieve his goal.

## Production and release
An anime film adaptation of Black Clover was announced in Weekly Shōnen Jump in March 2021. On March 13, 2022, in the 15th Issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump, it was announced that the anime film will open in 2023 with Yūki Tabata serving as the chief supervisor and original character designer. In October 2022, it was announced that the film would feature a returning staff and cast from the television series, with Ayataka Tanemura directing, Pierrot producing the animation, Johnny Onda and Ai Orii writing the scripts, and Itsuko Takeda designing the characters. The film was initially set to be released simultaneously in Japanese theaters by Shochiku and digitally on Netflix internationally on March 31, 2023, but was later postponed to June 16 of the same year due to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting its production.[9][1][10][11]

On April 29, the movie's official twitter account announced that the production for the film has been completed.
